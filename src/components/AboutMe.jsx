        I’m a Full Stack MERN developer with a strong passion for building
        efficient and user-friendly web applications. I graduated this year from
        UTN (Universidad tecnológica nacional / National Technological
        University), but my journey in web development began around two years
        ago through self-directed learning. For the past year, I’ve been
        applying these skills in my current job, where I’ve developed custom web
        tools that helped solve real operational challenges and significantly
        improved day-to-day workflows. I’m always looking for new ways to
        improve, grow, and create impactful solutions through code.
